# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This is a final project I did for Web Programming Class.

Rock-Paper-Scissor Type of Game with a Bit of Twist: Mario! 

Specifications: 

1) Your project should consist of an HTML document and 3 directories for each of the following: 1) an external JavaScript file which contains all your JavaScript code, 2) an external CSS file, and 3) all your image files. 

2) The game will need to use images. For  example a  rock, paper, scissors image. You will want to use different images such as cat, dog, bird or whatever the theme of your game may be.  Incorporate some type of image rollover or image change in response to the mouse. 

3) Utilize an event listener to detect when a user has selected their object (such as the cat, dog, or bird).

4) Generate an integer random number for deciding on the computerâ€™s choice.

5) In the game screen, add text or images to the document for the resulting player win or lose. The game screen must also have: 1) a counter of some sort that indicates how many rounds have been played, and  2) the current game score (like the number of user wins and the number of computer wins). 

6) Part of your challenge is to create a user interface that is easy to navigate but entertaining to play as well. To that end, all user output should utilize the innerHTML property to write text to the page. Do NOT use popup windows (alert, prompt, or confirm) or document.write.  

7) Comment your code with informative or helpful comments and add your name to the top of the code. Also indent your HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make everything readable. 

8) Your game should run as expected without errors, so be sure to test!  HTML and CSS should pass W3C validation. You do not have to pass JSLint or JSHint, but these sites are very useful for spotting errors in your code. We will talk about JSLint and JSHint during the quarter.
